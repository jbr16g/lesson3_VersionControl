## Project Description:
Write 5 topics that I learned about version control and Git this week.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control is a procedure for recording changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can view past versions later.
2. A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revert a file or set of files back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem and when they did it (revision history), merge changes to the same file, and more.
3. The remote repository refers to a repository that resides on a centralized server (referred to in git as a remote server) that is shared among multiple team members. A local repository is a repository that lives on the local machine of a single user and has all of their files and commit history. 
4. Git is an open source (free and publicly available for access) distributed version control system that was originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds with performance, security, efficiency, and flexibility in mind.
5. Developers like Git because it’s a distributed version control system that allows every user to have a complete working copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine thereby allowing access regardless of whether or not you have an internet connection. Additionally, unlike some version control software, Git doesn’t focus on file names but instead on the changes between different versions of raw file content.
