            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a procedure for recording changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can view past versions later. This process what created to digitally keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can easily look back in the revision history and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake. This technique is particularly useful for <em>teams</em> of developers that may be continually writing new code and changing existing code for some software or a site. Version control protects source code from both unexpected corrupted files and bugs caused human error.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revert a file or set of files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem and when they did it (revision history), merge changes to the same file, and more. Basically, using a Version Control System means that if you mess up something or lose files, you can easily recover your work. In addition, files cannot be overwritten and can also have multiple people working on the same files simultaneously without an issue.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote vs. Local Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A major part of understanding version control systems is learning how git’s two repository types, local and remote, work. The remote repository refers to a repository that resides on a centralized server (referred to in git as a remote server) that is shared among multiple team members. Using this repository, team members can “push” commits to it when they’ve completed sections of the code that they’re ready to share with the team. An interesting thing to note about these types of repositories is that while one team member’s local repository can technically be shared to be used as a remote repository for the team, it’s common practice to host a remote repository on the main company server. A local repository is a repository that lives on the local machine of a single user and has all of their files and commit history. This allows for users to either create new repositories only to be used by them or clone an existing remote repository to their own computer for personal use.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is an open source (free and publicly available for access) distributed version control system that was originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds with performance, security, efficiency, and flexibility in mind. It’s very important to stress just how much Git improves the performance of programs by eons without consuming a lot of memory or code space. Because it’s a <em>distributed</em> version control system, it allows for every development team member’s code to act as a repository that can contain the full revision history of all the changes. Many developers love this project because it’s easy to learn, incredibly useful, and actively maintained.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why do developers use Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Developers like Git because it’s a distributed version control system that allows every user to have a complete working copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine thereby allowing access regardless of whether or not you have an internet connection. Additionally, committing new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for speed and efficiency. The algorithms that comprise this software use a library of common attributes from real source code file trees and compares how they are similarly modified over time. Unlike some version control software, Git doesn’t focus on file names but instead on the changes between different versions of raw file content. The final reason why developers love Git is because it has been designed with integrity as a top priority. It does this by safeguarding the content of files as well as the true relationships between files, directories, and other objects in the Git repository with a digitally secure hashing algorithm called SHA1 that protects against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.</p>
